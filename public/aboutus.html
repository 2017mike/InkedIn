      <h1>About InkedIn</h1>

      <p>InkedIn is a marketplace specifically for tattoo designs. InkedIn was conceived when we saw tattoo artists posting
        their designs on social media, and we wondered whether there might be a better place for them to do business. So we
        made it.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p>
        InkedIn has two types of posts: offers and requests. An offer is where any artist can put their tattoo design up
        for sale. Once someone buys a design, they can take it to their local tattoo artist to have it done. Alternatively,
        the artist and buyer can also meet up if they wish.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
        A request is a post where someone can post a picture and/or description of a tattoo they would like, and an artist can
        design that tattoo for them. The specifics of each deal can be worked out between the two parties (InkedIn does not
        handle transactions).
      
      </p>
      
       <p> The beauty of InkedIn is that anyone can get a tattoo design from artists all over the world. We hope that InkedIn makes it possible for people to get designs from their favorite artists no matter where they are in the world. </p>
